## 📖 Overview

One of the biggest challenges many foreign residents face in Japan is **waste sorting**.  
Rules vary by municipality, are often very detailed, and in most cases, **information is only available in Japanese**.  
For example, PET bottles must have the **cap** and **label** removed, and even items like chopsticks or paper waste are handled differently depending on the city.  

**EcoNavi** was developed to support **foreign residents in Japan** who struggle with these complex, Japan-specific rules.  
Simply take a photo of your trash with your smartphone, and the AI will identify the item and show the correct sorting method according to your local regulations.  

**“Make life in Japan easier, and kinder to the environment.”** — that is EcoNavi’s mission.
